# Vision Statement
The Ed-Easy Agenda System (E-EASy) will be used by educators, students and parents to promote communication of both class and individual progress. It will maintain information including but not limited to due dates, test dates and important events added by educators for each class they teach and in turn, be personalized and viewed by each student taking multiple classes.
 
The E-EASy will be an interactive calendar designed from the ground-up for grade school academic purposes. Educators will be able to create course plans that include a variety of events that can include a date, a time, a location. These course plans will be shared with students, who will be able to subscribe to the plan to add all associated events to the students’ calendars. 

One of the primary users will be educators, and they can use the system to view the classes they have on a specific day, record what was done in each class, and set upcoming events. They will have the option to make these events and class information public or private, with the default being set to private. Another feature of the system will allow educators to track their students progress by having a list of past due assignments and tests, and marking them as completed.
 
The other primary user will be students. They will have the schedules of all the classes they are attending which they can stack into daily agendas. Their calendars should reflect all of the events that their educators for each class has set. They will also be able to see which assignments they have completed, and potentially mark assignments as completed for personal use.
 
The final user will be students’ parents. They should be able to have access to the daily schedule of their children.  They also should be able to have multiple children’s accounts attached to theirs in the case where they have multiple children using this program regardless of their ages. Another feature will allow educators to poll parents to see whether they have seen the marks that their children have received for a specific assignment.
 
No permissions or account types will be needed to separate teacher and student accounts. Any user can create a course plan and share that course plan with any other user through the use of a unique code. Likewise, all users will have a private code that they can use to share their private schedule details with a second user. It will the user's responsibility to share codes with the appropriate audiences.

This scheduler will be a self-contained Android application. Future releases can expand into the iOS environment and integrate web-based course plan editing.By improving the communication between all the users, this system will allow everyone to be held more accountable. Educators in terms of material and reasonable times for returning grades, students for completing assignments and tracking when their tests are, and parents for understanding their children’s actual progress.
 
The first way that we can measure our success with this system is by polling all users for their opinions about this system, hopefully receiving positive feedback. We can also track usership of this program, if users are logging in and using this application once or even multiple times a day, we will know that our system is being integrated into our users’ lives. We can alpha test with some teachers only allowing some of their classes to use the system, and monitor success with assignment completion. Lastly, parents should find that they are informed about their children's studies throughout the semester.
